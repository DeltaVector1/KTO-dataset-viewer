## KTO dataset viewer

Small zero-dependency, self-contained dataset viewer for KTO datasets in the Axolotl Argilla format, Just needed smth basic.

1. Open `index.html` in any browser.  
2. Drop your `.jsonl` file onto the dashed zone.  
3. Instantly see:
   - Each instruction with its completions side-by-side.  
   - Labels color-coded ✅ True / ❌ False.  
   - Global stats: label ratio & unpaired True samples.
- Perma dark theme
- Auto-groups identical instructions.  
- Flags any True sample lacking a paired False sample.

I might flesh it out more in the future, Maybe a CLI version? Dunno.
